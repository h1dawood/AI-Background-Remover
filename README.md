## ‚ú® Features

*   **Client-Side AI Processing**: Utilizes the power of Transformers.js to run the AI model directly in the browser. This ensures user privacy as images are never uploaded to a server.
*   **High-Accuracy Model**: Employs the state-of-the-art `briaai/RMBG-1.4` model, which is designed to effectively separate foregrounds from backgrounds across various image types.
*   **Multiple Background Options**:
    *   **Transparent**: Get a clean PNG with a transparent background.
    *   **Solid Color**: Pick any color using a convenient color picker.
    *   **Gradient**: Choose from a selection of beautiful, predefined gradients.
    *   **Custom Image**: Upload your own image to use as the new background.
*   **Versatile Export Formats**: Download the final image in high-quality **PNG**, **JPG**, or **WebP** formats.
*   **Intuitive User Interface**: A modern, responsive interface with drag-and-drop support, a "Try an Example" option, and real-time status updates.
*   **Fast and Efficient**: The tool provides instant background removal without server latency.

## üöÄ How It Works

This application harnesses the power of modern web technologies and on-device machine learning to deliver a seamless experience:

1.  **Model Initialization**: On loading the page, the `briaai/RMBG-1.4` background removal model is downloaded and initialized using the Transformers.js library.
2.  **Image Input**: The user provides an image via drag-and-drop, file selection, or by using the provided example.
3.  **Client-Side Inference**: The AI model processes the image entirely within the user's browser. It analyzes the image and generates a precise mask that isolates the foreground subject.
4.  **Canvas Rendering**: The original image and the AI-generated mask are combined on an HTML canvas. The chosen background (be it transparent, a solid color, a gradient, or another image) is applied.
5.  **Instant Download**: The final composed image is displayed and made available for immediate download in the user's preferred format.

## üõ†Ô∏è Technology Stack

*   **AI/ML**:
    *   **[Transformers.js](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers.js/index)**: A JavaScript library from Hugging Face that allows running cutting-edge AI models directly in the browser.
    *   **[briaai/RMBG-1.4](https://huggingface.co/briaai/RMBG-1.4)**: A highly accurate, state-of-the-art background removal model.
*   **Frontend**:
